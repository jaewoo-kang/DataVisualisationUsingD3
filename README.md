**Master Project: Data Visualization Using D3.js**

Mapping Population Dynamics and Geographic Insights Using D3

**1. Abstract**

This project is a web application that visualizes various datasets through fix charts, including global population density, population trends by country, birth rate trends by country, a Voronoi diagram of U.S. airports, Walmart’s growth over time, and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) by country. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js, and TopoJSON, and d3-geo-voronoi, the application combines geographic and statistical visualization techniques to create an interactive, user-friendly platform for exploring data trends.
